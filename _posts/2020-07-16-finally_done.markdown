I am happy to write that I passed my last assessment and I am now headed to graduation. Oh man what a journey this has been. I am so glad to write that I was able to finish and build all my projects and that I was able to pass all of the assessments. It's amazing to see the progress I made from the beginning to today. I know so much more than I did before starting the journey, I also know that there is a vast amount of knowledge to learn and so much room for growth as a developer as well. I am so glad that I was able to learn all languages and frameworks that were taught at Flatiron, but I am also very grateful that I can now understand things when I look at code and documentation. It really does feel like I was able to learn how to learn and I know that might be the most important skill in the tech industry today.

I want to thank all the instructors, coaches, and fellow students that have been a part of this journey at Flatiron. I am very excited now to start my job search and start a new career in tech.
