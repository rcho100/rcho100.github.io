Back when I was in college, I remember the struggle of making a choice of what major to declare and what to pursue in my studies. There were so many things I was interested in, it was hard for me to pick one path for a future career. My interests ranged from things like business, music, and even history. Eventually I decided to pursue studies in economics and graduated with an economics degree. 

I started working in the insurance industry, and while it was a good experience, I found myself wanting to learn other things to advance my career for the future. It was at that time, a friend of mine introduced me to the world of software development. He showed me how I can learn coding online with a relatively low price and once I began digging online, I discovered that there were many free resources available as well. I had always thought before that there was a high barrier to entry in learning to code and I never really bothered with it in the past. As I started to learn, I soon found myself getting a rush when  I understood a concept and when a program would do what I planned it to do. I quickly realized that this had the potential of becoming more than a hobby for me.

With some more research, planning, and some faith, I made the decision to change careers, to fully devote myself to learn how to code and think like a software developer. No doubt there will be many challenges along the way, but I'm excited to work to overcome them as I start this new chapter of my life.
